# speech-text



Project Description:
This project is a simple voice-based interaction system built with Python. It uses two powerful libraries: pyttsx3 for converting text to speech and speech_recognition for recognizing what the user says. Here's how it works:

The program listens for speech input from the user.
It then recognizes the spoken words and converts them into text.
The recognized text is printed to the screen so you can see what was heard.
Finally, the program speaks back the recognized text using pyttsx3, making it a fully interactive voice response system.
This project combines speech recognition and text-to-speech technology to create a simple, yet effective, way to interact with a computer through voice.
